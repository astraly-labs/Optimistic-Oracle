#Â Pragma Optimistic Oracle

> This repository details the first implementation of an optimistic oracle for prediction market. 


## Project presentation

 - In the first deployed version, we will be introducing a trusted optimistic oracle. A multisig set among a list of trusted actors will be responsible for the resolution. Everyone will be able to dispute, providing a bond. Full documentation available soon.

    PragmaOO->>User/PredictionMarket: Notify of AI evaluation
    User/PredictionMarket->>User: Inform result and dispute window

    alt No dispute during window
        PragmaOO->>PragmaOO: Settle assertion
        PragmaOO->>User: Return bond
        PragmaOO->>User/PredictionMarket: Assertion settled
    else Dispute raised
        User->>User/PredictionMarket: Submit dispute with bond
        User/PredictionMarket->>PragmaOO: Forward dispute
        PragmaOO->>PragmaOO: Initiate dispute resolution
        Note over PragmaOO: Dispute resolution process<br>(for now it's a multisig, <br>staking will be implemented later)
        PragmaOO->>PragmaMultisig: Question the multisig
        PragmaMultisig->>PragmaOO: Display final result
        
        alt Original assertion upheld
            PragmaOO->>User: Return original bond + dispute bond (minus fees)
        else Dispute upheld
            PragmaOO->>User: Transfer both bonds to disputer (minus fees)
        end
        
        PragmaOO->>User/PredictionMarket: Final settlement result
    end

    User/PredictionMarket->>User/PredictionMarket: Update market state
    User/PredictionMarket->>User: Inform of final outcome
